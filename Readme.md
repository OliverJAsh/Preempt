Preempt
=======

Add pre-emptive searching to an input element. Pass in an async function
that takes a string and calls back with a list of suggested results, and
a template to render the data.

The suggested results are then displayed in a list beneath the input, and can be
clicked or interacted with the keyboard.

*Browser Support*: IE6+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari

A demo can be found at: http://bengourley.github.com/Preempt/example/

## Dependencies:

This module depends on jQuery (DOM, events and animation) and Underscore
(templates, utilites).

It is up to you to ensure these dependencies exist. In the example, these are
hotlinked from Google's CDN and GitHub. You should do something better in
production.
